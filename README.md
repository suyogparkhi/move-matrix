# MoveMatrix

MoveMatrix is a composable DeFi primitive generator built on the Aptos blockchain using the Move programming language. It enables developers and non-technical users to create, configure, test, and deploy customizable DeFi applications by composing standardized financial primitives through an intuitive visual interface.

## Project Overview

MoveMatrix leverages Move's resource-oriented programming model to ensure security and composability while providing intuitive visual tools for product creation. The platform is designed to abstract the complexity of blockchain development and allow users to focus on building financial products.

### Key Features

- **Visual Composition Interface**: Drag-and-drop interface for composing DeFi primitives
- **Primitive Library**: Collection of standardized, audited DeFi building blocks
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on composition validity
- **Code Generation**: Automatic generation of Move code from visual compositions
- **Testing & Simulation**: Tools to test compositions under various market conditions
- **Deployment Management**: Streamlined deployment to testnet and mainnet

## Architecture

MoveMatrix employs a multi-layered architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: React-based UI components for composition, testing, and deployment
   - Composition Interface with drag-and-drop capabilities
   - Primitive Library browser
   - Parameter configuration forms
   - Validation feedback display

2. **Application Layer**: Core business logic 
   - Composition Engine for managing primitive connections
   - Validation Service for real-time checks
   - Code Generator for translating visual compositions to Move code

3. **Smart Contract Layer**: Move modules implementing DeFi primitives
   - Lending Pool, AMM/Swap, Staking, and Vault primitives
   - Composition validator for security checks
   - Deployment manager for on-chain interactions

## Current Implementation

The current MVP implementation includes:

- **Composition Canvas**: Interactive canvas for creating and connecting primitives
- **Primitive Nodes**: Visual representation of DeFi building blocks
- **Parameter Forms**: Configuration interface for each primitive
- **Validation Panel**: Real-time feedback on composition validity
- **Code Display**: Generated Move code with syntax highlighting

### Core Components

- `CompositionCanvas`: Main drag-and-drop interface for building compositions
- `PrimitiveNode`: Visual representation of individual DeFi primitives
- `ParameterForm`: Configuration form for primitive parameters
- `ValidationPanel`: Displays validation results and suggestions
- `CodeDisplay`: Shows generated Move code with syntax highlighting

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/demo` to access the composition interface

## Development Roadmap

The project is currently in MVP phase with plans to expand:

1. **Additional Primitives**: Options, derivatives, governance, and oracle primitives
2. **Advanced Testing**: Monte Carlo simulations and risk assessment tools
3. **Ecosystem Integration**: Connections to existing DeFi protocols
4. **Marketplace**: Community-created primitives and templates
